# You will use what you've learnt to create a text-based (command line) program that takes any String input and
# converts it into Morse Code.
#
# You've created plenty of text-based programs in Days 1 -10, so look back at some of those projects if you don't
# remember what a text-base program looks like.

# Wikipedia Entry for Morse Code
#
# The design, functionality, code style is all up to you. You're wearing the big-girl/big-boy pants now. So you get
# to decide.


from key import key

# ask for input()
morse_input = input("What would you like to translate to morse?: ")

# split the input into individual letters

# use those letters to find corresponding code from key.py

# get the output and print it.

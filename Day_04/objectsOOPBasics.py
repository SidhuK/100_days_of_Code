# Procedural programming

# Increasing complexity makes everything confusing

# Maintain simple relations in code for more complex project

# Breaking projects into different tasks, and separate modules.

# Modules could be reusable if needed.

# can't create large project with just procedural programming

# OOP models a real-world object

# an object will have attributes (variables), like what it has, and methods i.e. what it does (like functions).

# in OOP, methods is basically the functions a particular object can do.

# multiple objects can be generated from the same type

# "class" generates multiple "objects" (multiple blueprints created from same class)

# like a car is a class and different types of cars is an object

# car = CarBlueprint() (first letter of each word capitalized), car is the object created from the carblueprint class.
